- Put all code into `generate.py`;
- `prompt.py` includes constants and prompts *ONLY*.
- Prioritize short, simple, readable code with minimal lines.
- Avoid using try-except blocks unless absolutely necessary for flow.
- When catching exceptions, keep the surface area small and log succinct, actionable messages. Don’t swallow errors that affect correctness.
- Use Type Annotations.
- Don't put import or from statements inside the code, only at the beginning of the script.
- When printing lists, print each item in a new line.
- Follow Pythonic style, but be pragmatic—clarity and speed over perfection.
- Adhere to PEP 8 Standards.
- Use f-Strings.
- Employ Context Managers.
- Use list comprehensions. 
- Add comments and docstrings.
- Reuse existing functions or classes when possible—don’t rewrite them unless the prompt says so.
- Avoid redundency. 
- Keep functions short and modular.
- Always encapsulate new functionality in methods.
- Avoid unnecessary boilerplate, patterns, or abstractions—opt for fast, working code.
- Take your time to reason through the code before suggesting.
- Quality, clarity, and correctness are more important than fast completions.
- Prefer complete and coherent code blocks over partial or rushed suggestions.
- Always update the README.md if new features or significant changes are introduced.
- Match library usage to the versions specified in `requirements.txt`.
- For OpenAI SDK (openai>=1.30), use the modern client: from openai import OpenAI and client.chat.completions.create(...). Avoid legacy v0 API patterns.
- Don't create tests.
- Don't design or implement fall-backs.
